# Thoughts in general
The Voron is not a cheap printer. It is also a most modifiable printer on the market. We have freedom to choose parts quality and vendors. This project is an attempt to use the highest quality parts in a pursuit of high quality prints.
# BOM
- Fasteners
  - [Anodized, magnetic, high grade](https://www.boltdepot.com/Metric_socket_cap_Class_12.9_alloy_steel_black_oxide_finish_3mm_x_0.5mm.aspx)
    - 12.9 seems to be the highes grade. I wonder if there is a way to get the "nice finish" variant of it. Really smooth and precise.
- Motion
  - [ ] [Powge](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255800751045001.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt&_randl_shipto=US)?
    - Need to do more research.
  - [ ] HIWIN:
    - [ ] [Chaoticlabs](https://chaoticlab.xyz/products/mgn12h-mgn9h-mgn7h-hiwin-guide-rail-1?variant=40350092820578) for ~$60. I am researching if that is a real HIWIN or a copy
    - [ ] [Made by HIWIN, in Taiwan](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804708445237.html) if there is such a thing
    - [ ] [MotionUSA](https://motionusa.com/manufacturer/hiwin/mgnr12r0370hm-e10-e10-hiwin) $126.00 for the rail and $46 for the [carriage](https://motionusa.com/manufacturer/hiwin/mgn12hzfc-hiwin)
  - [ ] Schneeberger:
    - [ ] at [rs-online](https://us.rs-online.com/product/schneeberger/mn-12-1000-10-15-g1-v1/71904298/) for the rail and carriage separately. The total price is around $300
  - [ ] IKO: Seems to be even more expensive.
- Electronics
  - Controller:
    - [ ] [BTT Octo Pro](https://biqu.equipment/collections/control-board/products/bigtreetech-octopus-pro-v1-0-chip-f446?variant=40310085812322): That seems to be the most flexilbe option. Also, so far it's to only way to use 48v motors. The Manta seems great as well, however, the CB-1 board might not be the best option, compared to OrangePi5B.
    - [x] [BTT Octopus Max EZ](https://biqu.equipment/collections/control-board/products/bigtreetech-btt-octopusmax-ez-for-3d-printer): I ordered this one. With 6 5160Pro RGB. Because Gucci.
  - Klipper host:
    - [ ] [OrangePi 5B](https://a.co/d/esz9qjP): I orderd this board. It's seriously awesome. The eMMC boot is ~8 seconds to Klipperscreen. It handles 60FPS FullHD with no issues. It handles 30FPS on 4K. The negative side, the GPIO is not 40 pin. The IO2CAN won't fit it.
    - [ ] [BTT PI](https://biqu.equipment/collections/control-board/products/bigtreetech-btt-pi-v1-2?variant=40326121980002): Not as powerful. But it does have native [CAN](https://biqu.equipment/collections/control-board/products/bigtreetech-btt-pi-v1-2?variant=40332289867874) "HAT"-ish board.
    - [ ] Original [RasPi4](https://www.pishop.us/product/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-8gb/). The availability is still an issue. I got couple boards, so I might use one in this build. I got the [IO2CAN](https://github.com/bigtreetech/IO2CAN) and a POE HAT for it. Ideally, I would love to run the Klipper on POE and use the [BIGTREETECH Relay V1.2](https://biqu.equipment/collections/expansion-board/products/bigtreetech-reply-v1-2-automatic-shutdown-module-after-printing) for the power management. We'll see how it goes.
  - CAN? [EBB2240](https://biqu.equipment/collections/expansion-board/products/bigtreetech-ebb-sb2209-can-v1-0?variant=40214283485282)
    - 2290 vs 2240, SPI vs UART. Need to research more. Also, there might be some other options.
  - [KnoMi](https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-knomi-v1-0?_pos=64&_sid=e57d520f8&_ss=r)
  - SSR
    - [ ] [Omron](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/omron-automation-and-safety/G3NA-210B-UTU-DC5-24/634443?): 10A? 1.1kW is bit tight. Need to research if it makes sense to add more amps.
    - [x] [D2440](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sensata-crydom/D2440/221764): 40 AMP for $63.58. Looks like a great option. With [KS101](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sensata-crydom/KS101/4303644) cover for $5.52

    - [ ] motechmotor [MT-1705HS200A](http://motechmotor.com/productDetail-0104-31.html) 60mm not sure if it's going to fit. The rest seems interesting.

    - 750W? It would be interesting to see how fast it would heat up.

- Meshing/QLG
  - [ ] [Beacon](https://beacon3d.com/product/beacon) I bought it, but it's not clear if I will end-up using it in the build. The need to have uniform magnet backing on the build plate might be a deal-breaker. I have a MandalaRose mag bed and I like it alot. I might be wrong, but the magnetic sheet seems to be the biggest contributor to bed variance. I will keep this one open.
  - [x] [Mellow Voron CNC Tap](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805587288451.html): I can't resist a shiny CNC. This skeletonized TAP looks amazing. I will update, when it arrives.
